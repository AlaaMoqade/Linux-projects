one of the best palace i visited in my cuntry palestein:
1- jerusalem : it was a wanderful experience, praying,visiting historical places,and waiking through the markets of jerusalem.

2- hepron :, it was an amazing experience walking through markets and eating its popular cuisine.

3-jericho : one of my favorite places .takes you deep into history when you see deir qarantul and beauty of the dead sea during sunset.

4-Bethlehem : iwas happy to learn about the various civilizations in my country,and that was when i visited the church of the nativity and delved into the
culture.

5-Jaffa : where the dream that was deprived of us by the occupation was to see the sea and enjoy the magic of jaffa.
